# Guess The Number

## ABOUT

A simple vanilla JS number guessing game with hints. Try to solve it in as few guesses as possible!

5 different hints are available:

- The number is even or odd
- The number is higher or lower than 50
- The number is higher or lower than your last guess
- If the number is double digit, one of the digits in the number is \_ (this hint is not available if it is a number below 10)
- The number is divisible by \_

## //TODO:

- "Previous hints" list to help you remember what hints you've already received
- Refactor code
- Add tests
- Improve accessibility (outlines aren't very visible, input has no label)
